# Wulan Maiduo's Story
## Debut
Maiduo made a stunning first appearance by defeating three Corruscers in a row with her Six Harmony Spear, showcasing her exceptional combat skills and courage as a Dragon Bone Village practitioner.

## Heroic Sacrifice
To cover Mark’s mission of repairing the shielding tower, Maiduo voluntarily unlocked her Source Substance Potential to lure a swarm of Corruscers away from her allies. Despite her enhanced abilities, she was overwhelmed by the monster horde and sacrificed herself heroically, becoming a symbol of bravery in Dragon Bone Village.
