# Wulan Chagai - Maiduo's Falcon Companion
Wulan Chagai is a small falcon and Maiduo’s inseparable partner. It provides aerial reconnaissance for Maiduo by sharing visual perception, forming a seamless air-ground combat linkage that is key to Maiduo’s battlefield success.

Beyond combat, Chagai is also Maiduo’s closest emotional support, accompanying her through every battle in Dragon Bone Village until her final sacrifice.
