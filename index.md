A pivotal new character in *Ling Cage Season 2*, Wulan Maiduo is a practitioner from Dragon Bone Village, voiced by Xu Jiaqi. She is the daughter of Wulan Aodeng (mentor of returning-to-origin training) and younger sister of Wulan Haisang, also serving as the first "Justice Monitor" for the village’s children.

With a gentle yet brave personality, Maiduo is a master of the Six Harmony Spear and forms an unbreakable bond with her falcon companion Wulan Chagai. Her heroic sacrifice to protect Mark and Dragon Bone Village makes her one of the most touching characters in the early part of Season 2.
